          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>We found that the states with the lowest rates of poverty were New Hampshire (9.2), Maryland (10.1)
            , Connecticut at (10.8), and New Jersey (11.1). All of these states are in New England, all northern
            states, so geography may play a factor in poverty rates. The states with the highest poverty rates
            tended to be in the deop south, such as Kentucky (19.1), Lousiana (19.8), and Mississippi at an outstanding
            21.5% poverty rate.
          </p>

          <p>In terms of correlations, we found that lack of access to healthcare was primarily located in states with
            lower populations, like Idaho, Kansas, and Wyoming. However, Georgia and Florida, again two southern states,
            had alarmingly high levels of people without access to healthcare. And perhaps most shocking, especially
          for Texans, is that Texas tops the list of people without the ability to see a doctor, at a massive 24.9%.
        Nearly a quarter of the Lone Star state cannot get medical attention without paying a steep price. Texas was
      also among the highest in poverty, at 17.2.</p>
